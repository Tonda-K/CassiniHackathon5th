# Propositions

1. Define polygon including Croatia / Serbia border
2. Constrain the target area defined by the polygon
3. Draw circles with the radius = \<range\> / 2
   * To be able to return back or surveilance

## Summary

* Red dots represent border points
  * for simplicity, we constrained them to ~ 160
* Black circles represent area within the radius ~ 1km. That can be adjusted acording the specific type of drone
  * based on range, battery
* Small Blue dots represent closest point to the ANCHOR (blue marker) point
  * Anchor point in this stage represent orientation towards the country. It can also represent drone boxes (stations/HQ) - we can add more


Distances / Response times maybe challenging but I'll try to calculate at least something.
